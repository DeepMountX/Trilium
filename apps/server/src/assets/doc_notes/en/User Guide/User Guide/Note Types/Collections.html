<p>Collections are a unique type of notes that don't have a content, but
  instead display its child notes in various presentation methods.</p>
<p>Classic collections are read-only mode and compiles the contents of all
  child notes into one continuous view. This makes it ideal for reading extensive
  information broken into smaller, manageable segments.</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-item-id="e7f3117635b8c3e905c71f2839e331942"><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_8QqnMzx393bx">Grid View</a>&nbsp;which
    is the default presentation method for child notes (see&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_0ESUbbAxVnoK">Note List</a>), where the notes are displayed
    as tiles with their title and content being visible.</li>
  <li data-list-item-id="e27a2ec6976e44512c9c52ba8d7a2ef76"><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_mULW0Q3VojwY">List View</a>&nbsp;is
    similar to&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_8QqnMzx393bx">Grid View</a>,
    but it displays the notes one under the other with the content being expandable/collapsible,
    but also works recursively.</li>
</ul>
<p>More specialized collections were introduced, such as the:</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-item-id="eae5c2f56f9a75e7ed813fe419d4a05a4"><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_xWbu3jpNWapp">Calendar View</a>&nbsp;which
    displays a week, month or year calendar with the notes being shown as events.
    New events can be added easily by dragging across the calendar.</li>
  <li
  data-list-item-id="e24642a7a4c2443497fd814d78f1ca784"><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_81SGnPGMk7Xc">Geo Map View</a>&nbsp;which
    displays a geographical map in which the notes are represented as markers/pins
    on the map. New events can be easily added by pointing on the map.</li>
    <li
    data-list-item-id="eaa80d024c07145aa8f4443d86b01295e"><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_2FvYrpmOXm29">Table View</a>&nbsp;displays
      each note as a row in a table, with&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_OFXdgB2nNk1F">Promoted Attributes</a>&nbsp;being
      shown as well. This makes it easy to visualize attributes of notes, as
      well as making them easily editable.</li>
      <li data-list-item-id="ec7243729048b57d173e3f7dfb232adca"><a class="reference-link" href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/KSZ04uQ2D1St/GTwFsgaA0lCt/_help_CtBQqbwXDx1w">Board View</a>&nbsp;(Kanban)
        displays notes in columns, grouped by the value of a label.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>To adjust the view type, see the dedicated <em>Collections</em> tab in the&nbsp;
  <a
  class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_BlN9DFI679QC">Ribbon</a>.</p>
<h2>Use in saved search</h2>
<p>Since collections are based on the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_0ESUbbAxVnoK">Note List</a>&nbsp;mechanism,
  it's possible to apply the same configuration to&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_m523cpzocqaD">Saved Search</a>&nbsp;to do advanced querying
  and presenting the result in an adequate matter such as a calendar, a table
  or even a map.</p>
<h2>Under the hood</h2>
<p>Collections by themselves are simply notes with no content that rely on
  the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_0ESUbbAxVnoK">Note List</a>&nbsp;mechanism
  (the one that lists the children notes at the bottom of a note) to display
  information.</p>
<p>By default, new collections use predefined&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_KC1HB96bqqHX">Templates</a>&nbsp;that are stored safely
  in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_2mUhVmZK8RF3">Hidden Notes</a>&nbsp;to
  define some basic configuration such as the type of view, but also some&nbsp;
  <a
  class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_OFXdgB2nNk1F">Promoted Attributes</a>&nbsp;to make editing easier.</p>
<p>Collections don't store their configuration (e.g. the position on the
  map, the hidden columns in a table) in the content of the note itself,
  but as attachments.</p>
