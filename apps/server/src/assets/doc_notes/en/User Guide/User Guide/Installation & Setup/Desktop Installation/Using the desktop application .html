<p>Sometimes, setting up a <a href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/Otzi9La2YAUX/_help_WOcw2SLH6tbX">dedicated server installation</a> is
  not feasible. The desktop application ships with a fully functional server
  instance by default.</p>
<p>You can access this web interface locally by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:37840/login">http://localhost:37840/login</a>.</p>
<aside
class="admonition note">
  <p>The server embedded in the desktop application will only run as long as
    the desktop application itself is running. So closing the application will
    also close the server. To overcome this, you can try hiding the application
    in the system tray.</p>

  <h2>Mobile interface</h2>
  <p>By default, this will display the desktop user interface, even on mobile.
    To switch to the mobile version, simply go to the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/gh7bpGYxajRS/Vc8PjrjAGuOp/_help_x3i7MxGccDuM">Global menu</a>&nbsp;and
    select “Switch to the mobile version”.</p>
  <h2>Allowing the port externally on Windows with Windows Defender Firewall</h2>
  <p>First, find out the IP of your desktop server by running <code>ipconfig</code> in
    your local terminal. Then try accessing <code>http://&lt;ip&gt;:37840/login</code> on
    another device. If it doesn't work, then most likely the port is blocked
    by your operating system's firewall.</p>
  <p>If you use Windows Defender Firewall:</p>
